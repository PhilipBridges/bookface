A barebones social media site. Made using React/Apollo/Prisma. Built from my own Prisma boilerplate, the RAP-Boilerplate.

Has friend requesting, instant friend request notifications, popup chat, instant search, and a news feed.

Test at: https://radiant-savannah-60795.herokuapp.com/feed (using a test server, can take up to 30 seconds for the server to wake up)
